# 2024-01-04: Increase Memory Size for GoldenGate VMs

With the application of PSU OCT23 to Oracle DB, the memory size needed has increased.

The full details can be found in issue #[21](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/oracle-db-build/issues/21)
of the `oracle-db-build` repository.

I decided to increase the XEN allocation of memory to the GoldenGate VMs by
600 MB.
