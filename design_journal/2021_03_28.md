## Overview

I wanted to recreate the XEN server in an automated fashion.

# Design Objectives

I used my build diary for [VICTORIA](https://sites.google.com/view/yetanotherocm/home/system-builds/victoria)
as the basis for the Ansible scripts.

I want to experiment with using Golden Images to build my VMs, instead of
generating them from ISO builds when I want to create them.

# Directory Structure

## Ansible Directory Structure

The directory structure, for the Ansible scripts, is:

* `design_journal` (to be added later for my design journal)
* `inventory` (for storing one host)
* `logs` (for Ansible logs)
* `scripts` (for scripts that are not based on templates)
* `templates` (for scripts that are generated through Jinja2)

## XEN Directory Structure

The directory structure, for the XEN server, is:

* `/OVS`
  * `iso_pool` for storing the ISO images
  * `seed_pool` for the golden images
  * `running_pool` for the individual VM images

The use of `seed_pool` and `running_pool` are not per Oracle VM standards. All
VM images are supposed to be stored in the `seed_pool` and copied to the
`running_pool` on activation.

# Scripts

* `create_bridges.sh` is based on the build diary entry for [2015-04-04](https://sites.google.com/view/yetanotherocm/home/system-builds/victoria/2015-04-04-set-up-xen-network).

* `site.yml` is the standard name for the Ansible master script.
