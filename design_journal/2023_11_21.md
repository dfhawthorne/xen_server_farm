# 2023-11-21: Increased Memory for Goldengate

## Summary

As part of the orchestration for the build of the Goldengate cluster, the memory allocation for the Goldengate VMs needed to be increased from 3,176MB to 4,120MB.

Because the number of loopback devices is limited, I had to comment out the data for Ubuntu18.04.
