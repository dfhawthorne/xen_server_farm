## Using DHCP

With the use of DHCP for the gold image VMs, I can skip the configuration of the target VMs.

The variables, `ip_addr_1` and `ip_addr_2`, are removed from `sites.yml`. Also the steps for _Configure Target VMs_ are removed from `sites.yml`.

## Modification of Target VM Builds

Since the host name of the created target VM is `gold-image`, the configuration of target VM needs an extra step to set the host name.
