# 2023-03-02: New ISO Images Added

## Overview

I have added the latest DVD ISO images for Oracle Linux (9.1) and Ubuntu (22.04).

## Choice of Name

Even though the name of Oracle Linux DVD ISO images have changed from names starting with 'V' to a more sensible name (`OracleLinux-R9-U1-x86_64-dvd.iso`), I have followed the previous practice of creating a directory called `Oracle Enterprise Linux 9.1`.
