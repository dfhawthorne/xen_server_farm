# 2023-11-25: Added Script to Detect Linux Installation

I have added a script, `templates/install_linux.sh.j2`, to detect if an operating system has been installed in the disk image.

This is done through checking whether the first 1GB of the disk image is all zeroes or not. If it is all zeroes, the script fails, prompting the user to do a manual installation for the gold image.
