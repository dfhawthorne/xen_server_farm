# 2023-11-01 - Configure DHCP for Gold Images

## Overview

In order to overcome the problem of changing IP addresses for copies of gold images, I decided to create gold images that use DHCP addresses instead of manually assigned. This means that changing the MAC address in effect changes the IP address for the VM image.

## Options for DHCP Servers

There are three (3) options for a DHCP server:

1. Use Home Network Router
1. Add DHCP server functionality to `GRIDCTRL`.
1. Create a separate DHCP server

Options 2 and 3 would require me to investigate the use of multiple DHCP servers on the same LAN.

I went with option 1 as I use this option already and I am comfortable with it.
