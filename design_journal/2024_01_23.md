# 2024-01-23: Development Branch for Kickstart Investigation

I have created a new branch called `development` to accomodate work for the investigation of using Kickstart under Xen to build Gold Images.

I have created a shorten version of `sites.yml` (called `sites_with_ks.yml`) to drive the testing with OL8 only.

The presence of the attribute, `kickstart`, is used to generate the extra code to use KickStart.

Unfortunately, the code does not work. The GUI installer is still started.

I get the following warning

```
WARNING: ignoring "kernel" directive for HVM guest. Use "firmware_override" instead if you really want a non-default firmware
```
